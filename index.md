Hello, I am from Ukraine. On February 24 2022 russia started a large scale invasion of my homecoutry. A genocide of Ukrainian people has ensured. This is the largest war in Europe since WW2. The western world is not doing enough to help Ukraine survive and continues to operate businesses in russia and buy russian oil and gas.

In the mean time, my home city Kharkiv is shelled and bombed every day:

After a month long attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv russia has witdrew from Kyiv and moved its forces to attack cities in the east and south of Ukraine. Now journalists in Kyiv are documenting the genocide that russia is waging in Ukraine. Several commuter suburbs of Kyiv have beed razed to the ground. Executed civilians are lying along the strreets, many with hands tied behing their back. Civilians were killed indiscriminately while they were trying to flee. Women that managed to escape are reporting their husbands being killed and them being raped infront of their children. Retreating russians have left behind mass graves and mined roads, residential building, and corpses hoping to kill more civilians with the explosives. The world needs to act now.
